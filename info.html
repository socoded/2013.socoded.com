    <h3>A Web Conference in Hamburg</h3>
    <p>
      We are premiering this year as the two-day campfire event for developers in central Europe. Join 150 fellow coders in Hamburg to learn, teach, hack and have fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Coded is crafted to your convenience. We think good talks need their time to sink in. So we made room for you to think and talk about them. We think boring talks are annoying so we skip them and go only with a handful
      <a href="speakers.html">awesome speakers</a>
      each day. We think hacker conference should be about hacking. So we have rented a whole house to make room for you to mingle.
    </p>
    <h3>tl;dr</h3>
    <p>
      So Coded is awesome.
    </p>

      As a hack-centric but language-agnostic conference So Coded is the ideal setting for passionate developers — a perfect storm of tech interests. No matter if your pet peve is Ruby, JavaScript, PHP, C#, Java, or anything else. As long as you code, we got you covered. So Coded!

    <h3>The Venue</h3>
    <p>
      Be our guest in an old, remodeled police station which now features a large multi- purpose hall, two bars, and a plethora of smaller rooms for impromptu discussions, hang outs and hack sessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      With about a dozen high-quality talks sprinkled across two days, and with lots of breaks in between, the event is designed to foster organic communication.
      All talks will be streamed live to the bar, and there always will be time and space to connect with like- minded peers. We aim to make the classic “hallway conf” a first class citizen, complete with free beverages and nice food throughout.

    <h3>Beer Conf</h3>
    <p>
      When the So Coded scheduling master minds set the date for the conference they knew that a web conference can be exhausting sometimes. And so they called the Oktoberfest and made sure that they will start right after our conference is over. That is right: The 21st of October is the first Saturday of Munich's famous beer fest and we are going! We got 10 spots for an exclusive trip to Oktoberfest including:
      <ul>
        <li>Transportation from Hamburg to Munich (Sept. 21st)</li>
        <li>Stay in Munich for 2 days in the So Coded House!</li>
        <li>Get drunk with your fellow So Coded hackers and speakers</li>
        <li>Reservation in an Oktoberfest tent (including dinner)</li>
        <li>Transportation from Munich to Hamburg (Sept. 23rd)</li>
      </ul>
      Tickets for that trip are 420€ each.
