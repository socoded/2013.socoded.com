      Hamburg is well connected to all major European cities. While nearby cities as Berlin or Copenhagen are best reached by car or train, flying in is an option for almost any bigger city in Europe on a daily basis.

      Hamburg is well connected by train to all major cities in Germany as well as most of the big cities in the northern Europe neighborhood. To get to Hamburg by train please check
      = link_to 'Deutsche Bahn', 'http://bahn.de'
      for trips to Hamburg Hbf. It might be impossible to get quotes for international trips online. Please call Deutsche Bahn or your local rail road companies in these cases.

    %p
      Please note: Deutsche Bahn offers special prices for all travels booked up to 3 days in advance of your trip. Those tickets are then bound to a specific train and cannot be used on any other connection (eg. later trains). As the price difference can be significant it might be worth considering anyhow. Those special fares are limited in availability and are automatically displayed at the Deutsche Bahn booking system when available.

    %p
      There is another way to safe even more money. Ltur offers last minute train bookins up to 6 days in advance of your trip which might be even cheaper than the special fares of Deutsche Bahn.

      So Coded is located in Bergedorf at the outskirts of Hamburg. From Bergedorf you can reach Hamburg central station within 20 minutes using the S21 or S2 S-Bahn lines. They are running every 10 minutes during the day and every 20 minutes after 10pm. The last train on Thursday night is running short after midnight. Trains are running all night on Fridays and Saturdays. If you are lucky you can also catch a regional train to central station which cuts your trip down to 10 minutes. Check the
      = link_to 'HVV website', 'http://www.hvv.de/en/index.php'
      for more schedules and more information.

    %p
      So Coded tickets will double as train tickets throughout both conference days. All attendees will receive more information separately. If you need to buy extra tickets you have to buy them at a vending machine at any train station. Tickets are also sold on buses. You are not allowed to be at the tracks without a ticket. Trust us, it is a sad experience to get fined when just collecting a friend from the train without any intention to board a train at all!

    %p
      All tickets are valid on buses, S-Bahn, U-Bahn, all ferries and regional trains within the Hamburg borders. Just make sure to buy "Großbereich" tickets when travelling to or from Bergedorf. One way tickets allow you to change as long as you are not going back on your route.
