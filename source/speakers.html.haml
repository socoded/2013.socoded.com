      Jessica, maker of the things. When she is not busy crafting the UI at Engine Yard there is so much to do! Like: Building desks,

      sew things, glue things or just enjoy some expertly made coffee in and around San Francisco.

    %p
      We know Miss Allen for quite a while now and hereby declare it impossible to be in a bad mood while being in the same room with her. Our suggestion: Better come and hear her speak, learn how to build and finally become a happy human being again.
