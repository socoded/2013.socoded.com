      %ul
        %li
          = link_to 'Keynote \'09', 'slidedeck-templates/socoded-template.key'
        %li

    %h2 The Stage

    %p
      We are using a full HD presenter on a 3x2m canvas. Here are some rough renders of how folks in the front, middle and back of the room will experience the setup.
      %ul
        %li
          %a{:href => '/images/info/first_row.png'}
            = image_tag 'info/first_row_thumb.png'
        %li
          %a{:href => '/images/info/middle_row.png'}
            = image_tag 'info/middle_row_thumb.png'
        %li
          %a{:href => '/images/info/last_row.png'}
            = image_tag 'info/last_row_thumb.png'

    %h2 What else?

    %p
      All our talks will be recorded and will be released for free right after the event. Plus we're partnering with some local video geeks so that we can stream your talk to the bar and have almost zero post-production.
