    %h3 A Web Conference in Hamburg

    %p
      We are premiering this year as the two-day campfire event for developers in central Europe. With about a dozen international speakers we are bringing Ruby, Python, JavaScript, PHP and our shared passion for the web together. Join them and 150 fellow coders in Hamburg to learn, teach, hack and have fun.

    %p
      So Coded is crafted to your convenience.

    %p
      We think good talks need their time to sink in. So we made room for you to think and talk about them.

    %p
      We think boring talks are annoying so we skip them and go only with a handful

      each day.
    %p
      We think a hacker conference should be about hacking. So we have rented a whole house to make room for you to mingle.

    %h3 tl;dr

    %p
      Be our guest in an old, remodeled police station which now features a large multi- purpose hall, two bars, and a plethora of smaller rooms for impromptu discussions, hang outs and hack sessions.

    %p
      With about a dozen high-quality talks sprinkled across two days, and with lots of breaks in between, the event is designed to foster organic communication.
      All talks will be streamed live to the bar, and there will always be time and space to connect with like-minded peers.

    %p
      We aim to make the classic “hallway conf” a first class citizen. Enjoy two days of that, complete with free beverages and nice food throughout.

    %p
      We think hungry attendees are a shame and that food means more than
